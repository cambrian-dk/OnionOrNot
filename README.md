# NLP Classification for Satire detection

The genre of satire often falls through the cracks of real-fake news detection algorithms. This project aims to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) features as input data for various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, and find a locally optimal combination of features for separating news headlines into real, fake and satirical news.
